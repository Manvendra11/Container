What is a Container?
A container is a compact and self-contained unit that packages everything needed to run an application. This includes:

Code
Runtime
Libraries
All these elements are bundled together in a package known as a "Container Image."

What is the Difference Between a Container and a Virtual Machine?
Virtual Machines (VMs): A VM includes a full operating system along with the application and its libraries. Each VM runs its own complete OS, which can lead to higher resource usage and overhead.

Containers: Containers, by contrast, only include the application and its libraries. They rely on the host operating system and its kernel to run, making them significantly lighter and more efficient than VMs.

Benefits of Containers
The primary benefit of containers is their lightweight nature. Because they share the host operating system's kernel, containers require fewer resources, start up faster, and scale more efficiently.

What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to orchestrate containerized applications. It enables the creation of microservices-based architectures and automates the deployment, management, and scaling of containers.

What are Kubernetes Pods?
In simple terms, a Kubernetes Pod is a group of containers that are managed as a single entity. Kubernetes uses Pods to streamline the management and orchestration of containers, ensuring efficient operation and scaling.
